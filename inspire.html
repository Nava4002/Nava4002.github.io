        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>C.S. Lewis was a Christian author who used logic and philosophy to suppoert his Christian faith and created some of the most well known Christian books and his quotes are found everywhere today. His most famous pieces are the Chronicles of Narnia and Mere Christianity.</p>
